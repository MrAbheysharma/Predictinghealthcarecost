\textbf{Introduction}
\end{Center}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
The\ U.S healthcare cost has maintained an upward trajectory over time and is projected to keep increasing. As a share of the nation's GDP, healthcare spending accounted for approximately 18 percent compared to 11 percent in comparable countries like the United Kingdom and Canada.  In dollar terms, the cost of healthcare here is roughly double that of similar countries. Despite the Affordable Care Act reform program, there seems not to be a significant reduction in the trend. However, the objective of this project is to analyze the impact of potential drivers of US healthcare costs and make recommendations on possible strategies for reducing costs in the near future.

\begin{justify}
A few numbers number of stakeholders and professional bodies have analyzed US healthcare costs using trend analysis without recourse to quantitative research. However, a literature search indicated that very little quantitative research has been done to analyze healthcare costs using predictive analytics.
\end{justify}\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}\begin{justify}
In 2018, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) with Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) carried out a research on the topic: What Can We Do About the Cost of Health Care? The SOA is the worldâ€™s largest provider of actuarial research and education and KFF is a nonpartisan source of analysis of current health policy issues, with a long-standing interest in how health spending growth affects government, employers, and consumers. The research work explores U.S Health cost drivers to include price and interest, population, aging. It was reported that 50 percent of the increase in U.S. expenditure from 1996 to 2013 was due to an increase in price and intensity while 23 percent accounted for the population. The report identified that using Technology in Direct Patient Care can lead to prevent and diagnose disease (like cancer) at an early stage.

The analysis used from S$\&$ P Global (SNL) Market Intelligence, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Economic. The project explores the potential predictors of Healthcare costs across 4 states, New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), Pennsylvania (PA), and Illinois (IL) from 2005 to 2018 to include Population, Medicare and Medicaid claim incurred, Real Median Household Income, Percentage of Aging population(65 and over), Per Aging Female and Per Aging Male. The idea is to evaluate the impact of each variable on healthcare expenditure using statistical learning techniques and make future predictions of healthcare costs.

\begin{justify}
It is important to understand the predictors in detail to perform our analysis. The line chart above explains the percentage of aging population Female vs Male. It can be observed that the female population makes a more significant portion in the chart as compared to the male population. PA has a larger share of female and male elderly population relative to NY, NJ and IL. The female population of PA is a little above 20$\%$  whereas the male represents about 16.2$\%$  of the aging population in the year 2018. The reason for the growth from the year 2005 to 2018 is due to the aging of the baby boomers (individuals born between 1946-1964) and consistently low fertility rate. The female population in NY and NJ have close call between the percentages. It can be said that for NY had about 18.3$\%$  of the female aging population and NJ had 18$\%$  for the year 2018. IL had about 17.4$\%$  for the same population. On the other hand, for male population, similar ranking can be observed in terms of the state as mentioned but NY stated with 11$\%$  and was at about 14.5$\%$  for the male aging population. NJ started at about 10.9$\%$  in 2005 and then was at 14.3$\%$  in 2018. Last but not the least Illinois, there was a huge surge from 10$\%$  in 2005 to 14$\%$  in 2018 for the male aging population.

Real median household income measures the combined gross income of all members of a household. NJ has always topped the charts for Real median household income as compared to NY, IL, PA. NJ has seen a decrease from a little above $\$$ 80,000 in 2005 to $\$$ 74,094 in the year 2018. IL stands at $\$$ 70,000 in 2018, NY $\$$ 65,000 and PA at $\$$ 64,000 and all three states have crossed each other at some point or the other from 2015 - 2018

Per capita income measures the average income earned by each individual in a given area. In the year 2005, NJ was the best among all the four states by providing $\$$ 45,000 average per year to its residents. However, over the years NY slowly picked up to NJ and as of 2018, now NY provides a slightly higher average of $\$$ 69,000 as compared to NJ. IL and PA starting from the year 2009 have been going off of each other, pretty close in terms of their per capita personal income until 2018 at about $\$$ 56000-$\$$ 57,000. This describes the similarity between NY, NJ and IL and PA.

The population is a crucial factor to consider related to projects of this nature. NY undoubtedly has the highest population in comparison from the year 2005 to 2018. The reason for the population is due to NY being the most famous destination for working, positive net migration rate as well as the presence of the well-known metropolitan cities in the United States. The trend is later followed by IL and PA and NJ is the least in terms of population.

The\ plot shows the cost of healthcare per state with New York having the highest cost. The colors show the dominance of the democratic (blue) and republican (red) party for the respective states. NY is the highest in terms of healthcare cost due to higher taxes, and a lot of population.  PA is the next in terms of high expenditure, followed by IL and NJ. From the box plot it can be easily seen the difference between NY and other states, especially NJ. The expenditure gap between those two states is very high.

\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
The idea of PCA is to identify the variables that capture most of the information in predicting the healthcare costs. Information in this case relates to the sense of variability. With the principal component regression, the first five principal components capture over 90$\%$  of the total variation. This suggests that some of the predictors impact the direction of the response. However, there is no guarantee that the predictors will give the best direction for predicting the response. Fitting a least-square model might show otherwise. In this case, the PCA is a necessary condition but not sufficient condition to determine the direction of the response variable.

Increasing lambda 6 shrinks the coefficient to zero. For a relaxed log lambda value, the coefficients begin to increase, consequently, RSS for the coefficients are likely to increase. Increasing lambda helps to reduce (shrink) the size of the coefficients but not make them zero thereby reducing the variance.\par

The residuals are approximately normal with few points away from the line towards the lower and upper tail. The scale distribution plot does not indicate any presence of heteroskedasticity which implies the variance of the error term is constant (homoscedasticity).  The plot of the residual vs fitted shows that the observation point is an outlier (the 42-observation point). However, this does not seem to impact the model after fitting the model.

Using another approach called K-fold, which divides the data in k different fold and uses one entire fold as test data and rest as training. We do this on 10 folds for our model.

\begin{justify}
Using the 10-fold approach, we can see that we are able to achieve a lowest test error of 0.0098, highlighted in green on the chart, on the unscaled data which is lower than LOOCV (0.0123) and the validation set approach (0.054). This shows that the model is capable of calculating the Healthcare cost with the lowest MSE of 0.0098.

Similar to the linear regression, we fit the model on the training data set. For logistic regression, we used a threshold of 0.5. Any predicted value higher than 0.5 gets classified as High and Low otherwise. To evaluate the model, we computed the misclassification error i.e. 0.40 with an accuracy of 0.60. This is because our model has a high number of False Positives and False Negatives.

In Linear Discriminant Analysis, we set the threshold of the posterior to classify any probability higher than 0.5 as High and Low otherwise. The misclassification error for LDA is 0.15, which is lower than Logistic Regression. This means that the LDA model is able to classify the healthcare cost correctly 85$\%$  of the time. This is seen in the confusion as there only few false positives and false negatives.

Contrary to the Logistic and LDA, when K = 4, the KNN classifier gives a misclassification error of 0.30. Interestingly, for Seed =1, there are no false positives and 6 false negatives. This is better than logistic regression but worse than LDA. For K=5, we are able to achieve a misclassification rate of .15, similar to LDA. However, there is a concern for overfitting as the lower the value of K, the lower the chances are of overfitting the model.
